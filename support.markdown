<p>The alarm time picker lets you choose the time when you want to be notified.</p>

<p>By default, the alarm time is set to the current time plus the <a href="#support-settings-default-alarm">default alarm value</a>.</p>

<p>The alarm time picker is configured with minimum and maximum values that correspond to the current service schedule. The system prevents you from scheduling an alarm outside of service times.</p>

<h5 id="support-alarms-notifications">Notifications</h5>

<p>Alarms are delivered by <em>notifications</em> at your chosen time.</p>
            
<p>You will be asked to grant Stations the permission to send you notifications after you've created your first alarm. <strong>You are strongly advised to allow them otherwise they will occur silently.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tap</strong> the stations tab's gear icon in the navigation bar to access app settings.</p>

<h5 id="support-settings-default-alarm">Default alarm</h5>

<p>This setting helps determine the default time of new alarms by adding this value to the current time. Adjust this amount to your preference. You can always tweak each alarm's time to your needs.</p>

<h5 id="support-settings-location">Use location</h5>

<p>Enabling location will sort stops on the stations tab by proximity to the device's position.</p>

<p>You may be asked to grant Stations the permission to access your device's location depending on your settings.</p>

<p>If you've disallowed location access and then change your mind, you may enable it again in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/iphone/iph3dd5f9be/14.0/ios/14.0#iph1572fd041">Settings</a>.</p>
